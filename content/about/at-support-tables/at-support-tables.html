    <h1>Assistive Technology Support Tables</h1>
    <p>
      As reports on assistive technology interoperability are made available by the ARIA and Assistive Technologies
      project, the APG Task Force adds a summary of assistive technology support to the relevant pages showing example
      implementations of APG patterns. This page explains how to interpret and use the assistive technology support
      summaries.
    </p>

    <section id="purpose">
      <h2>Purpose of AT Support Tables</h2>
      <p>The purpose of the support tables is to provide APG readers with a legible and actionable summary of the
        tests performed in the ARIA-AT project.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="meaning">
      <h2>Meaning of scores</h2>
      <p>Two scores are presented for each Assistive Technology and Browser combination for APG patterns that have
        ARIA-AT data available: Must and Should. “Must”
        failures block users. “Should” failures impede users. Learn more about ARIA-AT’s <a
          href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-at/wiki/Glossary#assertion-priority">definitions of Must and Should on the
          project wiki</a>.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="recommendations">
      <h2>Recommendations</h2>

      <h3>Understand the failures</h3>
      <p>Where possible, APG readers should avoid implementing patterns that have a score lower than 100% in the must
        column. If, however, you find yourself implementing a pattern with less than 100% in the Must column, you should
        take time to understand what is failing. You can learn more about the specific failures of a given pattern by
        clicking through to the detailed report on the ARIA-AT website.</p>

      <h3>Don’t Code to the Bugs</h3>
      <p>
        ARIA-AT is working with Assistive Technology vendors to get to 100% Must and Should passing rates. This means
        that Assistive Technologies which use ARIA-AT will change over time.
        When implementing a pattern that has less than 100% support for either MUST and SHOULD, be careful not to modify
        your code to accommodate the Assistive Technology failure, especially if doing so would affect passing Assistive
        Technologies.
      </p>
      <h3>Perform your own tests</h3>

      <p>The original purpose of ARIA-AT data are to help Assistive Technology vendors coordinate the interoperable
        rendering of ARIA. The ARIA-AT summary tables on APG should be used as an indicator for web developers about
        what
        areas to prioritize testing further, not as a final verdict on whether a feature in a web application will work.
        You should always test your application’s rendering with multiple assistive technologies.
